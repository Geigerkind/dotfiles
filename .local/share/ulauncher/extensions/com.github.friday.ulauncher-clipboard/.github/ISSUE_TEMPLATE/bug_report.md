* Describe your issue in detail (expected behavior and how the actual behavior differs)
* Include which clipboard manager you are using
* Make sure the issue is not with the clipboard manager. Use it independently from this extension to find out.
* If it doesn't work for you, try another one. I do not support clipboard managers, only the integration with them.
* Make sure your distro is updated.
* Include complete logs running ulauncher with `ulauncher -v`
